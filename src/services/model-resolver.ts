 * This is what fixes #526: core `/models/<dir>` only lists extensions in
 * `supported_pt_extensions` (no `.gguf`), so a static scan of MODEL_SUBDIRS misses
 * every GGUF model. But those files are not hidden — ComfyUI-GGUF (and every
 * derivative) registers its own categories (`unet_gguf`, `clip_gguf`) with a
 * `.gguf` filter, and ComfyUI serves them over REST like any other category.
 * Listing them surfaces GGUF models authoritatively: it reflects the LIVE server,
 * honours extra_model_paths, works remotely, and needs no filesystem scan or folder
 * guessing — each model is typed by the category ComfyUI itself registered.
 *
 * Why only `*_gguf` and not "every non-core category `/models` reports": `/models`
 * exposes category NAMES but not their extension sets, so there is no safe way to
 * tell a weight-bearing custom category from an extension-BLIND one (ComfyUI's own
 * `custom_nodes` / `datasets` register with an empty set and would list every file
 * under them — source code, arbitrary data — flooding the output). The `_gguf`
 * suffix is a reliable, self-describing signal for GGUF model folders (the subject
 * of #526) and cannot flood. Surfacing other loader categories (e.g. TensorRT's
 * `.engine`) is a separate enhancement that needs per-category extension knowledge.
 *

 * which case the caller still lists the core categories and, offline, the filesystem

/**
 * Enforce that a local model download can ONLY land where the running ComfyUI
 * actually reads model WEIGHTS — never in a directory it imports Python from.
 * Applied to the resolved write target BEFORE any mkdir/write.
 *
 * The veto set is built from the running server's OWN configuration and canonical
 * (realpath-collapsed) so it matches by real on-disk location regardless of mounts:
 *   • codeRoots (VETO, inclusive/over-veto) — the dirs ComfyUI IMPORTS PYTHON from
 *     (`custom_nodes`): each base-install dir's `custom_nodes` (from the base dirs
 *     the caller derived from the SAME /system_stats call), the models-root sibling,
 *     and every `custom_nodes`-category extra root (live AND static). A download
 *     must NEVER land inside one — that is arbitrary CODE execution, not a model
 *     install — so this is checked by RESOLVED REAL PATH, not category label, and
 *     it wins even when a model category also claims the same physical dir.
 *
 * A symlink/junction INSIDE the models tree may redirect the write anywhere that
 * veto does not cover (#870 — this SUPERSEDES the #633-era "only a live-registered
 * extra root authorizes an escape" rule, codex P0d). The redirect is a physical
 * fixture of the user's own models directory — placed there by the user or their
 * launcher — and ComfyUI's own scanner FOLLOWS directory symlinks
 * (`folder_paths.recursive_search` walks with `followlinks=True`), so a write
 * through one lands where the server actually reads. The earlier rule could never
 * authorize the mainstream StabilityMatrix layout: it junctions each shared model
 * folder (`models/vae` → `E:\comfy\StabilityMatrix\models\VAE`) and registers
 * NOTHING — the junction IS the registration, so no live-root lookup can vouch
 * for the target, and requiring one refused a correct install (a
 * could-not-determine → determined-not fold, pointed at refusal). An exotic
 * redirect that lands somewhere the server does not list is not hidden: the
 * post-write check (verifyLandedModel) reports it honestly.
 *
 * Hardening invariants (codex P0a/P0b):
 *   - The PRIMARY models root itself is code-root-vetoed: if it canonicalizes into
 *     a `custom_nodes` dir (e.g. `--models-directory <base>/custom_nodes`, or a
 *     models junction into custom_nodes), EVERY write is refused — the primary root
 *     is never blanket-exempt.
 *   - A path segment that EXISTS as a symlink but whose target cannot be
 *     canonicalized (dangling / circular / unreadable) is REJECTED — never treated
 *     as an absent segment (which would let a later recursive mkdir FOLLOW the link
 *     out of every root). Only a genuinely-absent segment (ENOENT/ENOTDIR from
 *     lstat) is safe to skip; any other lstat error fails closed.
 *   - An escaping symlink whose REAL target falls under a code root is REJECTED —
 *     the in-tree authorization above never extends to a directory ComfyUI imports
 *     Python from.
 *
 * ACCEPTED RESIDUAL (P0c — TOCTOU): this is a pathname-time check. The Node runtime
 * has no `openat`/per-segment `O_NOFOLLOW` traversal, so a LOCAL process that can
 * replace an accepted directory/symlink AFTER this check but BEFORE the writer's
 * mkdir/rename could still redirect the write. This race is inherent to pathname
 * validation (it affects any accepted path, symlinked or not). It is ACCEPTED as a
 * non-blocker: this runs on the user's OWN single-user machine, so a
 * concurrently-racing local process is out of scope (maintainer ruling —
 * "downloads should go where the user wants; it's their computer"). We deliberately
 * do NOT reject symlinked/external destinations to defend against it — that would
 * break the legitimate #633 external-drive and #870 StabilityMatrix use cases.
 * The refusals this guard DOES make are the ACCIDENTAL-corruption ones only: a
 * dangling/unresolvable escape (P0a) and a write into a code dir / custom_nodes
 * (P0b). Fully eliminating the race would require trusted directory-handle
 * traversal (native support) and is out of scope.
